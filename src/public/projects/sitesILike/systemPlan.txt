The client will get the cookie, containing key-value pairs
The key is the url, and the value is all data associated
with the url and the type of feed it contains.

For example, a wss feed will have the last seen ID,
An RSS feed will have the RSS file as a string,
And html tracking will have the html file, as a string.

so you read the cookies and send requests to the server,
which will later return the data it finds, aided by
the url query, and return the data, actually a key-value pair
of {url, data} as json, where we have a promise waiting. So it'll 
manage that new data, maybe fill up a list, and on command, 
rewrite the cookie.

For RSS, it can get... big. 
So I'll hash the feed items in a list.
< 4KB for a single cookie, and cookie limits to about 50...
